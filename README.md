# CD-Collection-Manager
During my C++ class we created a music library manager.

This manager lets you add a collection of CD's from a file.
After adding the collection you then have a few options:
 - You can Display the collection to the user,
 - You can Sort the collection using a bubble sort to sort by artist in ascending order,
 - You can search for a specific CD in the collection,
 - You can Edit the artist, title or year the track was released,
 - And lastly when you need a break there is a basic math quiz that sees if a number is even or odd, or a prime number.

I included the cd.txt file that was given to me in the class so that you can use the same exact thing I used.
